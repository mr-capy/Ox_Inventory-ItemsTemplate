## Items Template for [Ox_Inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory)
I put this together for my own server that I'm working on, but I thought I would share the items & effects. I'll add to it as I edit and add more items. Please note that if you want some of the items to work, you need to add the code in the proper files. I'll notate which files go where in the client / server code so that it should be easy to put together.

All I've done is make the items and make most of them work like they should. I didn't make any of the ox scripts nor am I part of the development team, all of the credit goes to [Linden](https://github.com/thelindat) and the [OverExtended Team](https://github.com/overextended). If you have any questions beyond "how do I add an item" or "what is a lua file", go check out their [documentation](https://overextended.github.io/docs/).

I'm here for the community and I support the idea to *learn* how to do these things on your own. It's the best way to make sure you don't waste any time, money, or get scammed.I'm also going to update this as I work it for my own server, so hopefully this can give you some enrichment for your server(s). I'm also open to ideas, cause that sounds fun.
